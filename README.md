# Open Company App Harness

A lightweight, open source blueprint for running a small internal cloud on a single machine: Git, SSO, reverse proxy, databases, observability, app deployment, and coding-agent workflows.

The project is designed for teams that want one server to behave like a practical company cloud: a place where code lives, internal apps run, users authenticate, services are observed, and coding agents can safely help operate the environment.

Internal tools are often small enough to build quickly but important enough to need Git, SSO, databases, health checks, backups, auditability, and a clear deployment path. AI coding agents make the building faster. This harness focuses on the system around them: the single-box cloud that turns generated apps into operated software.

## What This Is

Open Company App Harness is a reference architecture and starter kit for a self-hosted internal platform that includes:

- an ingress path from the public internet to private apps;
- SSO and access policy for internal tools;
- Git hosting and automation for app repositories;
- Docker Compose as the default runtime;
- shared services such as Postgres, Redis, and object storage;
- container and host observability;
- an app portal for inventory, deploys, health, and drift;
- an operational contract for each app with `company-app.yaml`;
- GitOps approval for first-time app onboarding;
- coding-agent instructions that let agents build and repair apps without broad production access.

It is not a hosted platform. It is a set of conventions, schemas, templates, compose files, runbooks, and implementation building blocks that a company can adapt to its own infrastructure.

## Why It Exists

Coding agents can produce internal apps faster than most teams can safely deploy them.

Without a harness, each app tends to grow its own deployment script, fixed port, environment variable pattern, auth behavior, and README. That works for one app. It becomes fragile at ten apps and risky at fifty.

Open Company App Harness creates a small cloud control plane around one machine:

- a standard ingress route;
- a default auth layer;
- local Git as the source of truth;
- shared runtime services;
- host and container visibility;
- a manifest for intent;
- a template for repeatability;
- checks for confidence;
- GitOps for approval;
- an orchestrator for runtime state;
- a portal for visibility;
- rules that agents can follow without needing production access.

## Single-Box Cloud

The central idea is that a single machine can provide the minimum useful shape of a company cloud.

That machine runs the control plane, the support plane, and the apps:

- code is hosted in the same environment through Gitea or another Git server;
- SSO is handled by Authentik or another identity gateway;
- public ingress enters through a tunnel and reverse proxy;
- internal apps run as Docker Compose projects;
- shared databases and queues run locally when the app does not need managed services;
- Portainer and Glances make the machine inspectable;
- an app portal records what should exist, what is running, and what changed;
- coding agents connect to the same machine and use the same contracts as humans.

This is not meant to replace AWS, Kubernetes, or a mature platform team. It is meant to cover the first, surprisingly large stage where a company needs internal software to be real, authenticated, observable, and repeatable, but does not yet need a distributed platform.

## Target Agent Experience

The intended setup experience is:

```text
User sends the GitHub repository URL to a terminal-connected LLM.
The LLM reads the repo, explains the stack, asks for local choices, generates a plan, applies approved steps, starts approved services, verifies health, and leaves the box ready for new app deploys.
```

The LLM should explain what will be installed before changing the machine:

- tunnel and ingress;
- reverse proxy;
- SSO/auth gateway;
- Git server and automation;
- Docker Compose runtime;
- shared Postgres, Redis, and storage options;
- Portainer and Glances;
- app portal / orchestrator;
- templates, schemas, and GitOps deploy flow.

The LLM should ask for values such as admin email, admin username, admin password or permission to generate one, base domain, install directory, tunnel provider, and whether it may start Docker services or create public routes.

See `docs/agent-setup-contract.md` for the full agent-readable contract.

## Reference Open Source Stack

The default mental model is a small, self-hosted internal platform built from replaceable open source components.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Internet[User / Internet] --> Tunnel[Cloudflare Tunnel<br/>cloudflared]
  Tunnel --> Proxy[Nginx / Nginx Proxy Manager]
  Proxy --> Auth[Authentik<br/>forward auth / SSO]
  Auth --> Apps[Internal apps<br/>Docker Compose]

  Apps --> Postgres[(Postgres)]
  Apps --> Redis[(Redis)]
  Apps --> Storage[(S3-compatible storage)]

  subgraph Support Plane
    Gitea[Gitea<br/>Git + Actions]
    Portainer[Portainer<br/>containers + stacks]
    Glances[Glances<br/>host observability]
    Portal[App portal<br/>inventory + deploys + health]
  end

  Gitea --> Portal
  Portal --> Apps
  Portal --> Proxy
  Portal --> Auth
  Portal --> Portainer
  Glances --> Portal
```

The entry path is intentionally simple:

```text
cloudflared -> reverse proxy -> auth gateway -> app
```

The support plane keeps the environment operable:

- Gitea stores repositories and runs GitOps workflows.
- Portainer gives visibility into containers, images, volumes, and stacks.
- Glances exposes host-level resource usage.
- The app portal records app inventory, deploy history, health checks, and drift.
- Shared services such as Postgres, Redis, and object storage are optional but standardized.

Every box can be swapped. The harness cares about the contracts between them: Git repositories, app manifests, reverse-proxy routes, auth headers, health checks, and deploy events.

## Deployment Control Loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Human[Human or team] --> Agent[Coding agent]
  Agent --> AppRepo[App repository]
  AppRepo --> Manifest[company-app.yaml]
  AppRepo --> Compose[docker-compose.yml]
  AppRepo --> EnvExample[.env.example]

  Agent --> Rules[Live harness rules]
  Rules --> Agent

  AppRepo --> Checks[Validation checks]
  Checks --> Request[Deploy request PR]
  Request --> GitOps[GitOps repository]
  GitOps --> Approval[Merge approval]

  Approval --> Orchestrator[Portal orchestrator]
  Orchestrator --> Runtime[Runtime host]
  Runtime --> Docker[Docker Compose app]
  Runtime --> Proxy[Reverse proxy]
  Runtime --> Auth[Auth gateway]
  Runtime --> Services[Shared services]

  Docker --> Health[Health checks]
  Proxy --> Health
  Auth --> Health
  Health --> Orchestrator
  Orchestrator --> Status[Status, events, history]
  Status --> Human
  Status --> Agent
```

The app repository says what should exist. The runtime host reveals what actually exists. The orchestrator compares both and records the difference.

## Core Idea

Every deployable app carries its operational contract in the repository:

```yaml
schema_version: 1

app:
  slug: example-app
  name: Example App
  owner_email: owner@example.com

runtime:
  type: docker-compose
  compose_file: docker-compose.yml
  service: app
  healthcheck:
    type: http
    path: /health
    expected_status: 200

deploy:
  enabled: true
  domain: example-app.internal.example.com
  port: auto
  env_file: .env
  env_example: .env.example

auth:
  required: true
  provider: forward-auth
  allowed_domains:
    - example.com
```

The harness validates that contract, checks the repository, and coordinates deployment through a controlled path.

## Operating Model

Open Company App Harness uses a two-stage deployment model.

### First deploy

1. A developer or coding agent creates an app from the template.
2. The app repository declares its contract in `company-app.yaml`.
3. Validation checks run without production secrets.
4. A deploy request pull request is opened in the GitOps repository.
5. Review and merge become the approval signal.
6. The orchestrator creates runtime state, proxy route, auth policy, environment, and health checks.

### Later deploys

After the app is onboarded, normal code changes can deploy from the app repository's default branch, as long as the app still satisfies the contract and platform checks.

## Suggested Stack

The reference stack assumes:

- Git server: Gitea, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, or GitHub;
- reverse proxy: Nginx Proxy Manager, Traefik, Caddy, or nginx;
- auth: Authentik, Authelia, OAuth2 Proxy, or another forward-auth provider;
- runtime: Docker Compose;
- portal/orchestrator: an internal app that records apps, deploys, checks, health, and events.

These tools are intentionally replaceable. The contract matters more than the exact vendor.

## What Makes This Different

This project is intentionally smaller than a full platform-as-a-service and stricter than a pile of scripts.

- It keeps the app contract in Git, close to the code.
- It lets companies run on simple infrastructure first.
- It treats AI agents as contributors that need rules, feedback, and boundaries.
- It separates validation from deployment.
- It keeps production credentials in the runner or orchestrator, not in chat, manifests, or app repos.
- It makes health and deploy state visible to humans and agents.

## Advantages

### For small teams

- Start with one host and Docker Compose instead of a full Kubernetes platform.
- Get a repeatable path for internal apps without building a large platform team.
- Keep operational decisions visible in Git.

### For platform teams

- Standardize app metadata, ownership, auth, health, and deploy behavior.
- Make drift visible by comparing Git intent with runtime reality.
- Introduce stronger backends later without changing the app contract.

### For coding agents

- Give agents a clear contract instead of tribal knowledge.
- Let agents fix validation failures from actionable feedback.
- Avoid giving agents broad production access.
- Make generated apps easier to review because they follow the same shape.

### For security and operations

- Pull requests run checks without deploy credentials.
- New apps require auth by default.
- Port allocation can be centralized.
- Secrets stay out of manifests and `.env.example`.
- Destructive actions are outside the default automation path.

## Lessons Behind The Architecture

This harness grew from a practical pattern: agent-built apps become useful quickly, but they need a boring operational path to stay safe.

The key lessons:

- A template is not enough. Teams need a contract, checks, and a deploy path.
- A manifest beats scattered README instructions because it can be validated.
- GitOps is useful for first deploys because it creates an auditable approval moment.
- Agents should prepare and repair deployment artifacts, not silently mutate production.
- Health checks need to be part of the contract, not an afterthought.
- Auth should be the default for internal apps, with explicit exceptions.
- Automatic port allocation prevents slow, hidden conflicts.
- The portal should observe and compare state; Git should remain the source of app intent.
- The simplest workable runtime is often the right starting point, as long as the contract can outlive it.

## Status

Early extraction. The first goal is to make the pattern easy to understand, install, and audit. The second goal is to provide a working CLI and a runnable local demo.

## Safety Principles

- Git is the source of truth for app intent.
- Pull requests validate without production secrets.
- Real deployment happens only after an explicit approval signal.
- App manifests never contain secret values.
- New apps use automatic port allocation by default.
- Internal apps should require authentication by default.
- The harness never deletes databases, volumes, repositories, stacks, or proxy routes automatically.
- Runtime changes should be previewable before they are applied.
- Agent-facing errors should explain the next fix, not just the failed check.

## Getting Started

Start with the docs:

- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/quickstart.md`
- `docs/agent-setup-contract.md`
- `docs/llm-bootstrap.md`
- `docs/app-contract.md`
- `docs/gitops-flow.md`
- `docs/security.md`

Then inspect:

- `templates/app/`
- `examples/minimal-web-app/`

## Bootstrap With A Terminal-Connected LLM

The repository includes a bootstrap playbook for agents that can use a terminal:

```bash
cp bootstrap/repos.example.json local/repos.json
node scripts/bootstrap.mjs --plan --repos=local/repos.json
```

The script asks for company-specific values, writes an inspectable plan to `local/bootstrap-plan.md`, and defaults to plan mode. It only clones repositories or writes local secret config when run with `--apply`, and it only starts services when `--start` is also provided.

For non-interactive smoke tests:

```bash
node scripts/bootstrap.mjs --plan --defaults --repos=bootstrap/repos.example.json
```
